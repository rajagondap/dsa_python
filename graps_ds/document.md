# What is graph?

A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of nodes and edges. 
Formally, a graph can be defined as an ordered set G(V, E) where V is called vertices and E is called the set of edges that are used to connect the vertices 

### Types
1. **Directed**   -  A directed graph is a set of vertices/nodes connected by edges, with each node having a direction associated with it. Edges are represented 
by arrows pointing to the direction in which the graph can be traverse. If there is an edge between vertex 0 and 1 with an arrow pointing towards 1, then the 
graph can be traversed from 0 to 1 and not from 1 to 0. 

2. **Undirected**  -  In contrast an undirected graph can be traversed in either direction. The edges are bidirectional. 
If there is an edge between vertex 0 and 1, then the graph can be traversed from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0

3. **Weighted Graphs**  -  Some graphs have weights associated with edges between two vertices. These graphs are called Weighted Graphs.
